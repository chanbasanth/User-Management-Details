# User Management Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **User Management Dashboard** is a simple web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details. 
The app interacts with a mock backend API (**JSONPlaceholder**) to simulate managing user data. 
It offers a clean and intuitive user interface to manage essential user data, such as **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email**, and **Department**. 
This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) along with features like pagination, responsive design, and error handling.
